# Visualization of Delayed Domestic Flights
Analyzed and manipulated the database containing 13k+ delayed domestic flights in US in one day, by using SQL. Visualized the result of the data analysis in an interactive map illustrating delayed flights as lines between airports by using Tableau, and delivered in presentation; showcased the distribution and the scale of delayed flights in US, each flight’s information and insights on mapping out delayed flights, for travelers’ reference

The application showcases the domestic flights in the United States on 1 January 2015. It is
analogous to the book’s data because it demonstrates each airports’ longitude, latitude, and
the distance between origin and destination airports. The lines change colors from the origin
airports to its destination airports. From the visualization, we can observe that the flights in the
contiguous 48 states are more frequent than the outlying states and territories. For the 48
states, the major hubs like DFW, JFK, and LAX have huge amounts of flights going in and out.
For the outlying states and territories, the flights to and from Hawaii and Puerto Rico are more
frequent than to and from Alaska and Guam, probably because of their famous tourism.
